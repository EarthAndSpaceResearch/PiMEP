<i><b>Software and documents developed in support of the PiMEP NASA-ESA Collaboration and Salinity Validation Data System</i></b>

<br>
ESAâ€™s Salinity Pilot Mission Exploitation Platform (<a href="https://www.salinity-pimep.org/">Salinity Pi-MEP</a>) is an innovative platform that allows users to evaluate the quality of satellite salinity data using matchups within situ data, statistical tools, mapping and visualization tools, and automated report generation.  
<br><br>
Scientists at <a href="https://www.esr.org/">Earth and Space Research (ESR)</a> continue to develop tools for calibration-validation of NASA Aquarius/SAC-D and NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data and are providing them to the Pi-MEP platform as part of this NASA-ESA collaboration.
